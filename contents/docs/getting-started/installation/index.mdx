description: Installation guide for installing my dotfiles.

<Note type="note" title="üìÑ Attention">
    This dotfiles configuration is written with Arch Linux systems in mind. While it may work on other Linux distributions, it is optimized and tailored specifically for Arch Linux. You may need to make adjustments for compatibility if you're using a different distribution.
</Note>

There are two ways to install these dotfiles:

   - <a href="#automated-installation">Automated Installation (Script)</a>: This method uses a script to automatically set up the dotfiles. However, the script is a bit messy and not perfect, so it may require some adjustments.
   - <a href="#manual-installation">Manual Installation (Recommended)</a>: This is the preferred method, giving you full control over the installation process and allowing you to customize each dotfile according to your needs.

It‚Äôs recommended to use the manual installation for a more reliable and tailored setup.

## Manual Installation
To get started, you can clone the dotfiles repository directly from GitHub.

## Automated Installation

<Note type="danger" title="Danger">
  The installation script is still a work in progress. Some features may not be fully implemented or tested yet.
</Note>

For a faster setup, use the `install.sh` script to perform an automated installation of the dotfiles in one step:

```bash
./install.sh
```

## Post Installation
After finishing the installation, there are a few more steps that you'll have to do in order to finalize the customization.

## Other configurations

  #### SDDM
    ```bash
      # Install the desired theme
      git clone https://github.com/aczw/sddm-theme-corners.git theme &&
      sudo cp -r theme/corners/ /usr/share/sddm/themes/
    ```
    After installing your theme, edit the `/etc/sddm.conf.d/kde_settings.conf` to match your theme name that is placed in `/usr/share/sddm/themes/`
    ```plaintext:kde_settings.conf showLineNumbers {10-11}

    [Users]

    # Copy your wallpapers into the created dir
    cp -r walls/* ~/.wallpapers/
    ```
